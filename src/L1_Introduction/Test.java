collection ---> is a concept
Collection ---> Interface 
Collections --> Class

Collection contains various data Structures which can be used to process data very smoothly with less code
In this tutorial we will cover each and every concept of Collection Framework

Interfaces:-
             Collection
            |     |     |
          List   Set   Queue

                 Map

so Collection and map are two different topics Map is not the part of Collection Interface 
We cant implement these interfaces directly, so we need some implementing classes 

Classes:-

                         List  ( is used when u want to (1) insert elements in order  (2) duplicates are allowed)
            |          |               |
        ArrayList     Linked List     Vector<--- Stack


                         Set (Set are used when u dont want insertion order and no duplicates are allowed
            |                 |
        Hash Set         Sorted Set(I)( When u dont want duplicates and want some insertion Order)   
            |                 |
        Linked HashSet     Tree Set

                          
                        Queue(When u r prior to processing then use it)
                |                          |
          Priority Queue                Blocking Queue
